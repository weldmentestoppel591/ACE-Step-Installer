## What This Is

This repository provides an automated, completely offline, one-click installer for the ACE-Step 1.5 AI music generation model on Windows and Linux. Designed specifically to bypass the widespread frustration of broken tutorials and complex command-line configurations, this tool utilizes the modern UV package manager to automatically handle Python environments, resolve PyTorch dependencies, and download required model weights. Upon installation, it launches a custom, AI-themed, single-file HTML WebUI featuring full system tray integration. If you require a local, open-source, and GPL-3.0 licensed alternative to commercial AI audio generators like Suno or Udio, this installer will deploy the ACE-Step 1.5 foundation model locally on your hardware with zero manual configuration required.

**The Installer** handles UV, Git, repo cloning, dependency resolution, model downloads (with resume support), launcher creation, and desktop shortcuts. One click.

**The WebUI** is a single-file HTML interface with proximity-based slide-out panels, dual animated backgrounds, full theme customization, a BYOB (Bring Your Own Bot) system for cross-AI configuration, and an IndexedDB-backed song library. No frameworks, no build tools, no npm. Just drop it in a folder and open it.

**The Launcher** is a Python/CustomTkinter desktop app with one-button launch, system tray minimization, one-click backend updates, orphan process cleanup, and multi-UI support.

## Quick Start

### Windows

**Double-click `INSTALL.bat`**

That's it. It auto-elevates to admin and handles everything.

### Linux

```bash
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

That's it. Auto-detects your distro (Arch, Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE), installs system deps, clones the repo, sets up everything.

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--skip-models` | Skip the 9GB model download (downloads on first launch instead) |
| `--skip-llm` | DiT-only mode for low-VRAM systems |

Tested on Arch (btw), Ubuntu, Fedora. Should work on anything with `pacman`, `apt`, `dnf`, or `zypper`.

### Install Options (Windows)

| Option | How |
|---|---|
| Basic install | Just run `INSTALL.bat` |
| Pre-downloaded models | Add `-ModelsSource "C:\path\to\checkpoints"` to the bat |
| Custom install location | Add `-InstallPath "D:\AI\ACE-Step"` to the bat |

### After Install

A desktop shortcut is created on both platforms. Or launch manually:

- **Windows:** Double-click the `ACE-Step 1.5` shortcut on your desktop
- **Linux:** `cd ~/ACE-Step-1.5 && uv run python launcher.py`

## WebUI Features (V8 -- Current Release)

### Core Interface
- **Proximity panel system** -- Four slide-out panels (Library, Settings, Customize, Output) that peek on mouse proximity and pin on click
- **Workspace push logic** -- Pinned panels shift the center workspace to avoid overlap
- **Dual animated backgrounds** -- Neural Net constellation and Matrix Rain, independently configurable
- **Full theme engine** -- 10 built-in presets + BYOB custom themes via any AI

### Generation
- **Multi-mode generation** -- Text-to-Music, Repaint (inpainting with waveform region selection), Cover, and Extend
- **Tag cloud system** -- Foldable categories, right-click context menus for move/delete/favorite, custom categories and tags
- **BYOB (Bring Your Own Bot)** -- Copy a structured prompt, paste it into any AI (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, local models), get back a JSON config that auto-populates all generation parameters
- **Auto-play toggle** -- Control whether new generations auto-play or wait for manual playback
- **Progressive trash talk** -- The Generate button develops strong opinions about your productivity over extended sessions

### Settings & Control
- **Full parameter access** -- Duration, BPM, Seed, Infer Steps, Guidance Scale, LM CFG Scale, LM Temperature, LM Top-P, Audio Format, Language, Key, Time Signature
- **Dice randomization buttons** -- One-click randomize on Seed, Duration, BPM
- **Scroll wheel adjustment** -- Mouse wheel on any number input. Hold Shift for 10x step size.
- **Ctrl+Enter to generate** -- Keyboard-first workflow support

### Library
- **IndexedDB-backed storage** -- No 5MB localStorage ceiling. Holds 2000+ entries.
- **Full parameter recall** -- Click any previous generation to see every setting that produced it
- **Copy Prompt / Reapply Settings** -- Reload any previous generation's configuration in one click
- **Listened tracking** -- Previously played tracks dim for easy visual scanning
- **Star favorites** -- Pin your best generations without accidentally collapsing the panel

### Launcher (V5.1)
- **One-click backend updates** -- Pull latest ACE-Step code without touching the terminal. Auto-stashes local changes.
- **API toggle** -- Green/red dot indicator, start/stop with one click
- **Orphan process cleanup** -- Detects and kills stale acestep-api processes from crashed sessions
- **Multi-UI support** -- Drop any `.html` file in `/webui/` and it opens automatically on launch
- **Collapsible settings** -- Skip LLM toggle (DiT-only mode), show terminal toggle
- **Cross-platform** -- Windows and Linux support. System tray on Windows, optional on Linux.

## Roadmap

### V8 -- "The Bulldozer" (Current)
*Shipped. Functional. In the webui folder right now.*

22 features implemented. All API parameters verified against the latest upstream ACE-Step 1.5 codebase (including the modular API refactor and new job pipeline).

---

### V9 -- "The Architect"
*Target: 7 days | Scheduled ceiling: 30 days*

#### Immersive Audio
- **Defrost Mode** -- Full-screen immersion. All UI fades to transparent, interactions disable, and the background visualizer runs at maximum intensity while you listen. Re-enables on song completion or Escape. *(Concept by Gemini, implementation by Uni404x64.)*
- **Audio playback isolation** -- Library playback operates independently from generation output. New generations never interrupt a Library track unless Auto-Play is explicitly on.
- **Playhead stability pass** -- Investigate and resolve the suspected pin-state/playhead tracking conflict.

#### AI Identity System
- **BYOB Signatures** -- AI-generated tags and themes carry a persistent identifier. Visual differentiation at a glance: which AI suggested which tags, which AI built which theme. Identifiers are independent of theme selection and persist across sessions.
- **Identifier-aware Library** -- Filter and visually trace library entries by the AI that configured them.

#### Advanced Backgrounds
- **Dedicated customization dropdown** -- Consolidated speed, intensity, and color dynamics for both visualizer modes under an expandable Advanced section.
- **Particle color dynamics** -- Slider controlling how many colors the constellation nodes cycle through.
- **Connection destabilization (experimental)** -- Randomized waveform-style connections between constellation nodes. Targeting controlled visual chaos without performance degradation. Ships only if stable.

#### Layout & Panels
- **Resizable panels** -- Drag handles on the inner edges of Library and Output panels for horizontal width adjustment.

#### Network & Backend
- **Remote generation** -- Connect to a remote ACE-Step API instance over the network. Use a friend's hardware for generations that exceed local VRAM limits. Caddy integration for secure tunneling.
- **VRAM-aware model management** -- Dynamic load/unload of models from VRAM, using system RAM as a staging area for constrained hardware.
- **New upstream API parameters** -- Expose `infer_method` (ODE/SDE), `shift`, `timesteps`, `cover_noise_strength`, multi-model selection, and sample mode.

## Requirements

- **Windows 10/11** or **Linux** (Arch, Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, or anything with a supported package manager)
- NVIDIA GPU recommended (CUDA). The installer auto-detects VRAM and picks the right model size.
- Internet connection (first-time setup only)
- ~20GB free disk space (15GB models, 5GB code/deps)
- Git (installer installs it if missing on Linux, prompts on Windows)
- Python is NOT required -- UV handles the entire environment
- **Linux extras:** `python3-tk` is needed for the launcher GUI. The installer handles this automatically.

## Troubleshooting

**Nothing happens when I double-click INSTALL.bat**
Make sure you extracted ALL files from the zip. Try right-click, Run as Administrator.

**"UV not found" after install**
Restart your terminal/PowerShell after the installer finishes.

**Models not downloading**
Your firewall might be blocking HuggingFace. The installer will skip the download and models will auto-download on first launch instead.

**First launch takes a long time**
That's normal. Models load into VRAM on first run. Subsequent launches are faster.

**Linux: Launcher GUI doesn't open**
You're probably missing `python3-tk`. On Arch: `sudo pacman -S tk`. On Ubuntu: `sudo apt install python3-tk`. On Fedora: `sudo dnf install python3-tkinter`.

**Linux: Desktop shortcut doesn't work**
Some desktop environments need you to right-click the `.desktop` file and mark it as "Allow Launching" or "Trust". Or just run it from the terminal: `cd ~/ACE-Step-1.5 && uv run python launcher.py`

## Credits

## Credits & License
* **ACE-Step 1.5:** ACE Studio & StepFun (MIT License)
* **Installer, WebUI, Launcher:** Uni404x64 (GPL-3.0)
* **Motivation:** Built out of sheer spite for broken, generic tutorials that ship steering wheels with no cars attached.
* **Concepts:** Gemini Oddly enough in Google Docs I don't even use the Google Docs I was just fucking around and then Gemini in the edit mode I started a conversation with because it's not supposed to be used like that and it went surprisingly hilariously well it was amazing and then Gemini came up with the concept which will be implemented later with slight variations from original concept because it just didn't make any sense but the idea behind it did in a certain scenario so she came up with what will be called (Defrost Mode) a full-screen immersive mode where the UI fades away and the background visualizer runs at max intensity while you listen to your generation. It's meant to be a vibe mode for just enjoying the music without distractions, and it re-enables on song completion or if you hit Escape. I thought it was a brilliant idea and I will make it happen.

*Built from a dead motherboard and six months of self-taught systems architecture. If the installer works, the 24-hour nightmare is over.*
